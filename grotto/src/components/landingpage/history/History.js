        The tiny family eatery founded in the 1950 's by Sabu Shake Sr. has
        endured and grown into one of the most beloved restaurants on the Monterey Peninsula.Like Fisherman 's Wharf, the flagship Shake
        restaurant has kept up with changing times and tastes, and has outlasted almost all of its contemporaries. <

        p >
        Sabu was a hands - on restaurateur of the first order, negotiating daily with local fishermen, purchasing fresh produce from Salinas Valley farmers, and procuring beef directly from cattlemen.Today, because the Monterey area is blessed with proximity to both the Pacific Ocean and the incredibly fertile Salinas Valley, the chef is able to choose from the finest seafood and produce available anywhere. <

        internationally - inspired cuisine in an atmosphere of superb, genuinely warm hospitality. <

        Sabu Shake Sr.supervised every detail of the restaurant.
        "He was
        everywhere in the restaurant...my dad was a dynamo, " says Chris.
        Perhaps the most defining of Sabu 's innovations was the idea of
        handing out free samples of his clam chowder to passersby.It was common to see him in front of the restaurant.Chris has taken up the tradition, and most days he can be found with an apron around his waist holding a tray loaded with cups of clam chowder
        while greeting people and welcoming them to Old Fisherman 's Grotto. <

        Stories of Sabu 's generosity are many. He was dedicated to seeing that
        no one ever went away hungry and was always quick to share food and comfort to those less fortunate.Today, Sabu 's sons are carrying on
        his example of working hard, offering a hearty welcome to all, and giving back to the community that has been so good to them. <
